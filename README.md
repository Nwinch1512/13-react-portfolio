# 13-react-portfolio

## Description

This repo contains all files related to the week 13 react portfolio project.

I was motived to rebuild my portfolio website in React to enable me to learn how to build applications in React. This website showcases projects I've worked on to potential employers and highlights skills I've developed over the course of the bootcamp. The website includes three pages: homepage, projects page and contacts page. The homepage offers a brief description of my skills and experience. The projects page includes links to six deployed projects in addition to their supporting repos. The contacts page provides information on how to contact me, and links to my GitHub and Linkedin profiles. It also includes a form with an event handler that greets the user. In addition to applying React, this project enabled me to practice importing font awesome icons, Bootstrap and CSS.
